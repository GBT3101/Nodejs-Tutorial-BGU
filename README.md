# Nodejs-Tutorial-BGU
Nodejs tutorial made for Ben-Gurion University students - making of a blackjack game Nodejs server.

# Overview
This repository is a server template made for the BlackJack Frontend project (Can be found here: https://github.com/GBT3101/FrontEndTool-BGU)

Please read these instructions till the end before you start coding! :)

# Installation

*Make sure you have `git`, `npm` and `Nodejs 7.2.0` installed on your pc.*

Install git (windows) - https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git#windows

Install node (& npm) - https://nodejs.org/en/download/

1. First, open your command line and clone / download this project to your pc:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:GBT3101/Nodejs-Tutorial-BGU.git
cd Nodejs-Tutorial-BGU
```
2. We want you to focus on NodeJS, so everything else is already set up (node modules, etc), just run this line to run the server.

```sh
node server.js
```
If you see "I am listening" on your cmd, you are doing fine, the server is up.

3. Let's make sure our server is ready, enter `localhost:3100` with any browser, do you see the message `This is the blackjack server, what do you want?`? Awesome, everything works just fine and you are ready to program the API.

# Deck Utils

If you have sharp eyes, you might have noticed `deckUtils.js` file, **No need to touch this code**, this is an exported JavaScript file that being imported into `server.js`, check out the code and see how it's being used, it's very straightforward.

# Implementing the API

1. get /drawCard
